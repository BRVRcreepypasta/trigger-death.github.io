      "I'm a sucker for titles that don't take themselves seriously.
      Shows that know exactly what they are at a meta level, and execute everything over the top.
      I can name quite a few anime that have low ratings, but are perfect in my eyes.
      Some of my favorites:\n
      * [Haiyore! Nyaruko-san](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11785/Haiyore_Nyaruko-san)\n
      * [Katte ni Kaizou](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10191/Katte_ni_Kaizou)\n
      * [Asobi ni Iku yo!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/6166/Asobi_ni_Iku_yo)\n
      * [Idol Mahou Shoujo Chiruchiru â˜† Michiru](https://vndb.org/v14973)"

      "*Taken to another world* series are another love.
      There's just something so fascinating about mixing the knowledge
      of fantasy and modern worlds.
      Also the *really* good writing for a lot of the popular ones is probably to blame.
      Some of my favorites:\n
      * [Hataraku Maou-sama!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/15809/Hataraku_Maou-sama)\n
      * [No Game No Life](https://myanimelist.net/anime/19815/No_Game_No_Life)\n
      * [KonoSuba](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30831/Kono_Subarashii_Sekai_ni_Shukufuku_wo)\n
      * [Re:Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu)\n
      * [Gate](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28907/Gate__Jieitai_Kanochi_nite_Kaku_Tatakaeri)\n"

      "I have never been so emotionally overwhelmed by the end of an anime as I have with Angel Beats.
      This show had a really unique premise with some lovable comedic gags that took full advantage of that.
      Angel Beats had enough impact on me to convince me to become an organ doner."
